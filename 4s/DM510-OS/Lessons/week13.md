1) (**important**) Name two differences between logical and physical addresses
   - Logical generated by CPU - physical actual addresses in memory
   - Logical addresses are mapped to the physical
   - Physical address – address seen by the memory unit

2) (**important**) Why are page sizes always powers of 2
   - Page sizes in memory are typically chosen to be powers of 2, which allows for efficient memory addressing and simpler memory allocation and management. By using a power of 2 for the page size, the page offset can be determined by a simple bitwise AND operation, making page table lookups faster. Dividing memory into equal-sized chunks also simplifies memory management.

3) Consider a system in which a program can be separated into two parts: code and data. The CPU knows whether it wants an instruction (instruction fetch) or data (data fetch or store). Therefore, two base –limit register pairs are provided: one for instructions and one for data. The instruction base –limit register pair is automatically read-only, so programs can be shared among different users. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this scheme.
   - Advantage:
     - Protection - Process only access to the addresses in its address space where it lives in main memory
     - Sharing: Multiple users can read instructions at the same time - save memory space and program loading is faster
 - Disadvantages
   - Fragmentation - Program split into two parts, it can lead to fragmentation of memory, especially if the code and data have different sizes. Reduced efficiency in memory usage.
   - Flexibility - Assumes all programs used the same size data and code
   - Overhead - Each memory access needs to be checked against both pairs of limit registers - slow downs and reduced performance.

4) (**important**) Consider a logical address space of 64 pages of 1,024 words each, mapped onto a physical memory of 32 frames. (Assuming word = 2B)
	    - How many bits are there in the logical address?
      $2^6 = 64, 6~bits$
      $2^{10} = 1024, 10~bits$
    Then $6+10 = 16 ~ bits$ are needed  
    
    - How many bits are there in the physical address?
      $2^5 = 32, 5~bits$
      $2^{10} = 1024, 10~bits$
      Then $5+10 = 15 ~ bits$ are needed 

5) What is the effect of allowing two entries in a page table to point to the same page frame in memory? 
   - Explain how this effect could be used to decrease the amount of time needed to copy a large amount of memory from one place to another. 
      - Instead of having to copy the entire data structure you could just give a reference to the data structure in memory 
   - What effect would updating some byte on one page have on the other page?
     - Doing this would cause side effects from one page to another

      - Offset = 3085 mod 1024 = 13
    -   42095
      - Page number = 42095 / 1024 = 41.108
      - Offset = 42095 mod 1024 = 111
    -   215201
      - Page number = 215201 / 1024 = 210.16
      - Offset = 215201 mod 1024 = 161
    -   650000 - 2000001
      - Page number = 650000 / 1024 = 634.77 to Page number = 2000001 / 1024 = 1953.1

      $2^8 = 256, 8~bits$
      $2^{12} = 4~KB, 12~bits$
      Then $8+12 = 20~bits$
    -   How many bits are required in the physical address?
      $2^6 = 64, 6~bits$

    -   An inverted page table





11) (**important**) Explain the difference between internal and external fragmentation.
    - External - total memory needed to satisfy a storage request exists but is not contiguous 
    - Internal - Allocated memory is larger than the memory needed to store a request. Internal memory in a partition that is not being used

13) (**important**) Most systems allow a program to allocate more memory to its address space during execution. Allocation of data in the heap segments of programs is an example of such allocated memory. What is required to support dynamic memory allocation in the following schemes?
    -   Contiguous memory allocation
    -   Paging









14) Explain why mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android do not support swapping.
    - They don't have as many resources, so they need to be very direct and strict when managing the memory
    - Due to the speed of the memory swapping could actually be a big slowdown in performance compared to what the storage device would normally do
    - Battery life swapping requires extra operations and therefore consume more battery life

15) (**should be very easy**) Assuming a 1-KB page size, what are the page numbers and offsets for the following address references (provided as decimal numbers)?

      Then 23 bits in total
      
    -   How many bits are required in the physical address?
      512 frames -> 9 bits

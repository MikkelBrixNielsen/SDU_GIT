Important dates and people: 
- Charles Babbage 1837 analytical engine
- Konrad Zuse plankalkül (plan calculus) 1942-1945 proposed notation (not implemented)
- Corrado Böhm 1951 first language with a compiler

JavaScript (or js) 
- Most used language: 
- many weird things since things were implemented while the theory for the same thing was being developed.

4 genres of programming languages  
- machine code (010100101)  
- assembly (AT&T etc…)  
- High level language (python, java, C, rust, etc…)  
- ad-hoc/visual (Visual basics, SQL, etc…) - dedicated to single task 

Programming styles (paradimes) (how to consider computation:  
- imperative (+ object oriented) you have a state then something happens, and you get a result.

- Functional (computation performed by functions, no states, no variable, the function writes itself and yields a result)

- Logic / declarative (propositional logic or something stronger or SSLD derivation, can be directional so instead of only going from input to output you can go from output to input)

- Functional logic (Merging the good parts of logic and functional programming)

First implemented efficient high-level language (Fortan) 1956 Jogn W. Backus at IBM  
- Had variables, loops, procedures, statement labels, etc.  
- Used for physics calculations back in the day  
- Newest version 2018 (still being developed and used)  
- Fast in memory location and things like that

Algol60  
- Designed in 1960 by a group of people including john McCarthy, Alan J., Perlis, Peter Naur, …  
- Grandfather of old imperative languages, had block structures, recursion and formal definitions, before there were only specifications given in formal language  
- introduced the "if B then C_1 else C_2"
- Deprecated  
- Developed in an America vs Europe battle

Cobol  
- Created by a consortium in 1958, designed badly used heavily in defence sector still used today not very favourable at universities  
- Business oriented computations  
- Poor control structure  
- Elaborate data structures, record type introduced for the first time  
- still used for legacy applications (want to face it out)

Basic  
- first for personal computing (1964)  
- Designed to be easy to learn and use  
- very simple, limited, though still general-purpose  
- Present-day is full-fledged language not basic or easy to learn any more

Simula 67  
- Extension to algo60  
- Designed for simulation concurrent processes  
- Created in Oslo  
- **introduced the central concept of object-oriented** **classes and encapsulation**  
- predecessor of smalltalk and c++  
- deprecated

Pascal  
- A conceptually simplified and cleaned-up successor (1970) of algo60  
- A good language for teaching structured programming  
- Its later extensions (e.g., Delphi) are fully fledged system programming packages  
- In the beginning declared arrays had fixed size, cannot be variable

C  (developed 1972)
- The implementation language of Unix – can be spread across multiple mainframes system call became popular here as well (good for performance)  
- Great tool for systems programming and software development language on personal computers  
- Once fashionable, still in use, but usually superseded by C++  
- Gives low level control over low level memory, instruction etc. (must be very careful or you’ll get a million segmentation fautls!!!!!!!!!!!!)

LISP  
- intended for AI back in the day (1958 John McCarthy)  
- Grandfather of Haskell  
- Used for doing symbolic computation  
- Computing on evaluation  
- Only languages for AI for years (Prolog is 12 years younger)  
- Many dialects, two standards (scheme, common lisp)

Prolog (Logical programming)
- very high-level language (1972)  
- Declarative based on a subset of LOGIC with proofs interpreted as computation  
- Very powerful  
- Non deterministic (built in backtracking)  
- Elaborate flexible pattern matching  
- associative memory  
- In skilled hands it is very strong tool  
- Datalog (simple version of prolog giving more power to explain data)

C++  
- Evolution of C in the 1980  
- Hybrid of object oriented and imperative  

Java  
- Sized down reworking of C++ designed in 1995  
- Full object orientation  
- Designed for internet programming but general purpose  
- Very used is in the top 5 most used languages Not to be confused with JAVA SCRIPT
---
Scripting languages  
- Perl (1987)  
- Python (1991)´

Web programming  
- JavaScript (1995)  
- PHP (1995)

Does not have all the structures of a more advanced language like C, or Java

---
“New” ones  
- Golang (channels for concurrency)  
- Kotlin (type interface)  
- Rust (Ownership system)  
- Typescript  (optional static typing – “Better version of JavaScript”)

Used for more specific use cases where the larger more general languages CAAAAN do it but something more specific is wanted.

Bad things to avoid  
- JavaScript: The Good Parts  
- “So, JavaScript… What’s up with that???” *Crowd goes wild*

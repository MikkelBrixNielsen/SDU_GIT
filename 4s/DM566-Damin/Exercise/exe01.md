e) Yes, a non-total function is also referred to as a partial function. A non-total function is defined for only some values of its input domain and may not be defined for all inputs. A partial function is another term for a non-total function that is used in mathematics and computer science to describe a function that is not defined for all inputs. If a function is not defined for all inputs, it is considered to be a non-total or partial function.
